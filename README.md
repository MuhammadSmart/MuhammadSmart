**Embedded Software Engineer | Automotive ADAS | S32k & S32N | C/C++ | Python**

I work on embedded automotive systems with a focus on ADAS ECUs, real-time software, and networked embedded architectures. My experience includes developing/debugging software and S32k & S32N, building communication stacks (CAN, Ethernet, DoIP, SOME/IP), and designing safety-critical features such as watchdog supervision and bootloaders.
I also develop Python-based automation tools and am expanding into backend engineering for embedded–cloud integration.
